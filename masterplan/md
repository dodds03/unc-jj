## 🎯 Target Audience

- Millennials and Gen Z navigating life, career, or purpose  
- Creators, freelancers, and founders in reflection mode  
- Soul-searchers who want insight without formal therapy or self-help clichés  
- People who value voice-driven, characterful interaction

---

## 🧩 Core Features & Functionality

- **Minimal Homepage**
  - Just a speech bubble icon and gentle microcopy: “Got something on your mind?”
  - Users speak or type first — that’s the trigger for Uncle JJ to respond

- **Conversation Interface**
  - Users send messages via voice or text
  - Uncle JJ replies with AI-generated voice and matching transcript
  - No mood picker — AI interprets tone and selects fitting mood (inspire, truth, entertain)

- **Wisdom System**
  - Admin-curated library of story fragments, life lessons, and JJ-isms
  - Tagged by mood and theme (career, love, focus, etc.)
  - Used as structured input for AI prompting

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Upload and tag content
  - AI-assisted mood/theme tagging (optional)
  - Manage story snippets and future voice assets

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (Recommended)

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui  
- **Backend & Storage:** Supabase (Postgres)  
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs or Play.ht  
- **AI:** OpenAI API (story injection + prompt engineering)  
- **Auth:** Anonymous (no login needed), Supabase auth for Admin only  
- **Hosting:** Vercel or similar

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Data Model

**Supabase Tables:**
- `stories`: text content, tags (mood, theme), optional audio
- `messages`: user messages + JJ's replies, mood interpretation
- `mood_tags` and `theme_tags`: taxonomy for content filtering

---

## 🎨 UI & UX Principles

- Mobile-first, minimal, warm
- Font combo: Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (UI/body)
- Colors: earthy brown (`#4E3A2D`), sunset peach (`#FDBA74`), warm neutrals
- Gentle animation (waveforms, fades)
- Emotional priority over features

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- No PII collected  
- Anonymous usage only  
- Admin dashboard requires auth  
- Option to log messages for learning, not linked to user identity

---

## 🛠 Development Phases

### Phase 1 – MVP
- Core homepage with minimal interface
- Speech input + text fallback
- Basic JJ reply system via OpenAI
- Pre-recorded voice replies (static generation)

### Phase 2 – AI-Powered Core
- Mood detection from user input
- Dynamic story injection from Supabase
- ElevenLabs custom voice
- Admin dashboard w/ tagging

### Phase 3 – Optional Expansion
- JJ Moments (bookmark/share quotes)
- Community-submitted stories
- Journaling tools
- Push notifications or daily check-ins

---

## 🚧 Potential Challenges

- Prompt tuning to keep JJ’s voice consistent
- Voice generation speed (latency)
- Making mood detection feel intuitive
- Keeping emotional tone balanced (not preachy or cliché)
